## Executive Summary Template
This executive summary is one of the mandatory deliverables when you submit your solution. Its structure follows the WDL evaluation criteria and it has dedicated sections where you should add information. Make sure your executive summary covers all the sections since it will be an integral part of the Insights Report and your evaluation. Make sure your content is relevant and straight to the point.
**There is no need to reach the maximum number of words.**

## 🛠️ Product
In this section you should define the product that can be created by using the model developed. Make sure that the product solves the problem in a holistic way, takes into account the constraints of the topic entities (specifically mention these constraints).
### Definition
Define in **one sentence** what product(s) could be built out of the code you produced.
Example: A dashboard that assists in traffic control


### Users
Describe who would be the users of your product and for what purpose would they use it.
Example: Traffic controllers use the dashboard during their work to better plan where to dispatch resources


### Activities
Describe what features your product has.
Example:
* Predicts the most likely locations for traffic accidents
* Suggests the fastest route from dispatch centres


### Output
Describe what the product outputs to the users and how it does that. You can add mockups and/or visualisations.
Example: Location of the accident on a map and suggest the fastest route from the dispatch centre.


### Scalability
Discuss the scalability and the ease of implementation of your solution in the scope of the topic entity. Feel free to mention any road blocks you see and how they could be solved.


## 🌍 Social Impact Measurement
This section will help to guide you on how to measure the impact of your product. Make sure that measurement is thoroughly quantitative, even if you need to estimate some of the numbers.
### Outcome
If the outputs are your immediate results, describe your long-term results. What do you want your product to achieve? What ''good'' are you creating?
Example: To decrease response time from dispatchers so that people in urgent need receive help faster.


### Impact Metrics
From the outcome, define **2 to 4 metrics** that measure, whether you are achieving that outcome or not.
Example:
* Average Dispatch Time
* Average Distance from Accident Location and Dispatch Center


### Impact Measurement
Since you cannot wait to see the impact of your product, estimate it. You can do that by either using the estimations/predictions of your model, market research, products from proxy industries and/or similar locations, etc.


Example:
* *Based on model predictions*: Our model estimates a decrease of 6 minutes of the average dispatch time and a decrease of the average distance of 200 metres
* *Based on proxy products*: Similar studies in other cities show that the dispatch time can be decreased by as much as 13 minutes, depending on the traffic intensity of that city.
